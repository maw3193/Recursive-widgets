TODO:
Floating windows which ask for a button-clicking prompt
Floating windows which want you to put some text in
Buttons can react to hovering and being held
Some widgets to be capable of expanding/contracting when frames are dragged bigger/smaller
Make the topmost widget the one that reacts to clicks, not the bottom one.
Make the last-clicked widget float to the top (?)

TOFIX:
