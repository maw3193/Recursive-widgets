DESCRIPTION:
Recursive widgets - a GUI library for widgets that contain other widgets.
i.e. panels are structured collections of widgets, frames are draggable collections of widgets.

TODO:
Floating windows which ask for a button-clicking prompt
Floating windows which want you to put some text in
Buttons can react to hovering and being held
Some widgets to be capable of expanding/contracting when frames are dragged bigger/smaller
Make the last-clicked widget float to the top (?)

TOFIX:
